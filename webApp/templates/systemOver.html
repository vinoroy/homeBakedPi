    <p>The HomeBakedPi project is a set of open source Python modules and Arduino code that can be used to assemble a home monitoring system.
    A typical system is composed of sensors and actuators that are connected to nodes. The nodesÂ  read the sensors and activate the actuators. Data from the sensors is transmitted to a Hub that acts as a coordinator for all of the home monitoring system activites.</p>
