SERVER CONFIGURATION


Important :

NAT

forward port 8080 to 80
forward port 8022 to 22


I used the following

http://137.175.164.12:8080/


I removed 5000 from the iptables


Outline :


1) On the router fixed the address of the raspberry pi so it is always the same

    192.168.0.138

2) Forwarded the port for SSH

    on the router forwarded port 8022 to port 22

3) Modified the raspberry pi password

    new pass : MillerBeer12zzz

4) Added key authentification for SSH

    https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md

5) Modified the ssh config file so that password identification is disabled

    sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    PasswordAuthentication no


6) Installed Nginx on the raspberry pi



7) Modified the ip tables according to

    https://www.linode.com/docs/security/securing-your-server/

    # this is to midify the firewall rules
    sudo nano /etc/iptables.firewall.rules

    # this is to update the firewall rules
    sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.firewall.rules

    # this is to check the firewall rules
    sudo iptables -L

    IMPORTANT MUST MAKE SURE THAT FIREWALL RULES ARE LOADED WHEN RASPERRRY PI IS STARTED
    (see article)


8) Installed fail2abn

    sudo apt-get install fail2ban

9) I wasn't able to install a virtual env correctly. The flask never got instsalled on the local env correctly

    http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

   However, I did install it globally

10) Configured the link for the Flask app to be called from nginx (web server)

    After numerous attemps from different tutorials. The only one that was really complete and worked correctly was
