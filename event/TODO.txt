 - remove the scheduler ... this is to complicated ... for an event to verify that another event has arrived it will wait
  and then pole the instrument data in question

  for example if we have a door opening event and the alarm system is on. We will wait 20 seconds and pole the rfid node
  to see if someone has tagged in in the last 20 seconds.

  this way the events are sequential in the business layer, no sceduled events and no loss of state

  the rfid node will be designed to store the tag id for 30 seconds in memory. So if it is poled it will return the last
  taged person in the last 30 seonds. Then data will be transmitted to the system to store the entry and the tag will be
  erased from node memory
