TO DO
-----

Current version :

version 0.7.x

left off :

P1
 - develop the event queue task treatment module

P2

 - the scheduling function of the actuators should be put in a separate class to be used by all

P3
 - change instID for sensorID (this is a deep one .. it even touches the db)
 - generalize comm util email agent so that it can connect to any smtp servers


Important note :
----------------

 - Version 0.3.2 represents a more drastic change in the code with the introduction
   of the hub of nodes, hence to go back to single node code base we must back up
   to version 0.3.1 or 0.2.2

 - Version 0.4 represents an architecure change. The homebakedpi web app will not longer be hosted on a remote host.
   The web app in 0.4will be hosted on the hub and will also act as a web app server.

 - Version 0.7 present another architecture change. The following is a list of the changes to the architecture and the infrastructure :
        1)  No hardware and software dependencies to the hub (ie serial communication between nodes and the hub, hard software links to actuators).
                - Communication between hub and the nodes will be done over wifi using a web api.
                - Selected actuators will need to be also activated over wifi via a web api (ie Insteon)

        2)  Prod DB will be copied from the dev DB with no data and a script will be created to reload the prod data. All time stamped data will
            be lost in the process

        3)  The dev and the prod will be setup on identical servers.

        4)  All development will be done directly to the dev server over ssh
