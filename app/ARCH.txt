ARCHITECTURE
------------

Functional architecture :

 - the system is composed of a hub, a web app and one or several nodes

 - the hub is the centralized component of the system responsible for
        - collecting data from the sensors attached to the nodes
        - storing the data from the sensors
        - verifying the thresholds and sending the notifications
        - sending command messages to actuator node

- a web app responsible for :
        - displaying the sensor data
        - allowing the user to adjust the parameters of the hub (arm and disarm intrusion monitoring, schedule lights, etc)
        - act as a gateway to receive data from nodes (sensors measurements, events)

 - there are two type of nodes in the system :
        - sensor node
        - actuator node

 - a sensor node is a decentralized component of the system composed of one or several sensors
   that measure :
        - discrete events (motion,contact switch, threshold acceleration, sound, RFID tag identification). Events are push type,
          meaning that a message is sent to the hub after an event has happened (door opening, etc).
        - continuous analog measurement  (temperature, humidity, pressure). This is of pull type, meaning that the hub
          sends a request to the node to get a measurement from a sensor

 - an actuator node is also a decentralized component of the system  composed of one or more actuators, such as
        - light switch control
        - door lock

 - nodes will regroup a set of sensors to implement a set of requirements
        1) Home environmental monitoring
        2) Home occupancy monitoring
        3) Home intrusion monitoring
        4) Home lighting control
        5) Exterior environmental monitoring

 - nodes are responisble for :
        - recieving and handling commands from the hub
        - notify the hub of an event (room occupation)
        - getting measurements from sensors
        - sending data back to the node


>>>>>>>>Technological architecture :

 - a long distance node is composed of :
        - an arduino microcontroller and software responsible for :
                - handling commands from the hub
                - getting measurements from sensors
                - preparing messages to send the data back to the hub
        - an Xbee radio (shield + xbee module) and configuration program for
          recieving and sending data from and to the hub
        - an array of sensors for making measurements on the physical environment.
          The sensor array composition is a function of the requirements to implement
        - a proto shield and various electronic components required to connect the
          sensors
        - a power supply
        - an enclosure

 - the server is composed of :
        - a linux based computer (raspberry pi) running a web server (nginx + flask)
        - python code that implements the functional requirements of the hub
        - python flask code that implements the functional requirements of the web app
        - an sqlite database to store the sensor readings and events
        - a wifi usb module
        - a power supply
        - an enclosure
