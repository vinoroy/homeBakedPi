PROJECT PLAN
------------

Goal :

The goal of HomeBakedPy is to elaborate a prototype of a home monitoring and
automation system that protect the home as well as to operate its vital systems efficiently.

Objectives :

 - gain expertise the technologies required to monitor and automate a home
 - monitor a home and control is vital systems
 - have fun

Deliverables :

 - working software and hardware of a home monitoring and control system
 - poster presentation
 - documentation

Deadline :

 - montreal mini maker fair 201x ?

Left off : - code the other instruments for the esp temp baro humidty module

Current high level work plan : setup the flask app and configure the nginx

+) setup the aq and prod environment on the raspberry pi 1 and 2
>) install current version and make sure it works on the aq

+) clean up homeBakedPi code to remove all old sensors

+) design and code a mock esp environmental node (esp code)
+) design and code env sensors for the environmental node in the homeBakedPi framework

+) design and order parts for the env node (temp, humidity and ldr)
-) construct the env node
>) design and code the esp software for the temp and humidity (esp code)

+) design and order parts for the occp node (door contact switch, dead lock switch and motion detection)
-) construct the occp node
>) design and code the software for the occp node (esp code)

-) design and code env sensors for the occp node in the homeBakedPi framework
