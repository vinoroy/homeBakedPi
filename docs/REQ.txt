REQUIREMENTS
------------

 1) Home environmental monitoring and notification

 - measure the environmental parameters (temp, humidity, lighting and pressure) at one or
   several locations within the home
 - monitor the environmental parameters based on thresholds. Each environmental sensor can be 
   attributed a high and low threhold wich will trigger a notification
 - issue notifications by email or text if an environmental parameter exceeds a threshold
 - display home environmental paramters on web portal (summary, tabular and graf)
  
2) Home occupancy monitoring and notification

 - identify home occupant entry via RFID tag reader and door contacts
 - monitor room occupancy via motion detection and sound sensor
 - visually monitor room with camera
 - notify by email and text home occupant entry
 - display home occupant entry times on web portal
 - display room occupancy on web portal
 - display images of rooms on web portal

3) Home intrusion monitoring and notification

 - identify intrusion using a combination of sensors (PIR, sound sensor, contact switch)
 - allow home occupants to arm and disarm intrusion monitoring
 - notify intruder with an audio message
 - notify home occupants of intrusion via email and text

4) Home lighting control

 - schedule light activation times through a web portal
 - control one or several wall plugin lamps at scheduled times
 - remotely turn on or off a light

5) Exterior environmental monitoring

 - measure the environmental parameters outside the home (temp, humidity, pressure and wind speed, rain)
 - measure the environmental parameters in the garden (soil temp and humidity)
 - the requirements here are essentially the same as home environmental monitoring. 
   The difference lies in the array of sensors (temperature, wind speed, humidity, rain, etc)


6) Home safety monitoring

 - detect state of the oven and range (on or off)
 - detect and notify fire
 - detect and notify gases
