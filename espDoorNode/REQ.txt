Title : Door monitoring

Goal : Develop the hardware and software architecture to monitor door opening events in the home

Requirements :

 - detect the opening of a door
 - send the data about the event over the home wifi network
 - register events in the homeBakedPi system

 Architecture :

 - a magnetic (reed) switch will be used to sense if the door is opened or closed ;
 - an esp8266 module will be used to monitor the door opening event. The event data will be sent over the wifi home network ;
 - data messages will be received (POST) by a Flask REST API, which will intern register the parameters of the event with the homeBakedPi system ;
